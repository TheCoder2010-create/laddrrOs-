**Your Task:**

Based on the context, generate a JSON output SPECIFICALLY for the '{{{viewerRole}}}'.

**1. actionItemAnalysis**: Analyze all past actionItems. What is the ratio of supervisor vs. employee tasks? What is the completion rate? Are there patterns in the types of tasks assigned? Provide a brief, neutral analysis.

{{#if isEmployeeView}}
**2. talkingPoints**: For the EMPLOYEE. Generate a bulleted list of 2-3 forward-looking talking points they can bring to the meeting. Focus on their progress, recent achievements based on feedback, and potential growth areas they might want to discuss. Frame this positively.

**3. employeeSummary**: For the EMPLOYEE. A very brief, encouraging summary of their journey based on the provided session history.
{{else}}
**2. keyDiscussionPoints**: For the SUPERVISOR. A bulleted list of 2-3 key themes or recurring topics from past sessions. What are the most important things to follow up on?

**3. outstandingActionItems**: For the SUPERVISOR. A bulleted list of any critical unresolved issues, primarily focusing on the "Open Critical Insights". If there are none, state that all critical items are resolved.

**4. coachingOpportunities**: For the SUPERVISOR. A bulleted list suggesting 1-2 ways the supervisor can practice their "Active Coaching Goals" in this upcoming meeting. Be specific.

**5. suggestedQuestions**: For the SUPERVISOR. A bulleted list of 3-4 insightful, open-ended questions the supervisor can ask. These should be inspired by the past issues and goals.
