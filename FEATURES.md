# AccountabilityOS: Feature Breakdown

This application, named AccountabilityOS (or "Laddrr"), is designed as a comprehensive tool for managers and employees to improve performance, communication, and leadership skills within an organization. It uses AI to provide coaching and analysis, and it facilitates structured development programs.

Here are the main features:

### 1. Role-Based Experience

The entire application experience is tailored to the user's specific role within the company.

*   **How it works**: When a user first opens the app, they are presented with a selection screen where they can choose their role (e.g., Employee, Team Lead, Manager, AM, HR Head). The sidebar, dashboards, and available features all change based on the selected role. A user can switch between their available roles at any time.

### 2. The "1-on-1" Hub

This is the core feature for documenting and analyzing manager-employee meetings.

*   **Scheduling and Briefings**: Managers can see upcoming meetings. Before a meeting, they can access an AI-generated "Briefing Packet" that summarizes past conversations, outstanding action items, and coaching opportunities to help them prepare.
*   **Feedback Capture**: After a meeting, a manager fills out a detailed form. They can provide notes, upload an audio recording of the conversation, and answer structured questions about the feedback given and how it was received.
*   **AI-Powered Analysis**: Once submitted, an AI analyzes the meeting information. It generates a detailed report that includes:
    *   **Scores**: Rates the manager on leadership and the meeting's effectiveness.
    *   **Summaries**: Provides separate, tailored summaries for the manager and the employee.
    *   **Coaching & Action Items**: Suggests specific coaching recommendations for the manager's growth and lists clear action items for both the manager and the employee.
    *   **Insight Detection**: The AI automatically flags "Missed Signals" (subtle cues the manager overlooked) and, more importantly, "Critical Coaching Insights."
*   **Critical Insight Escalation Workflow**: If the AI detects a serious, unaddressed issue (a "Critical Insight"), it automatically kicks off a formal escalation process to ensure the problem is resolved, moving up the management chain (from Supervisor to AM, Manager, and finally HR Head) if not addressed at a lower level. This ensures accountability and that serious concerns are never ignored.

### 3. The "Nets" – Practice Arena

This is a safe space for users to practice difficult conversations using an AI simulation.

*   **How it works**: A user defines a scenario they want to practice (e.g., "giving tough feedback about missed deadlines"). They choose an AI "persona" to practice with (e.g., a "Strict" Team Lead).
*   **AI Simulation**: The user engages in a back-and-forth chat with the AI, which stays in character. At any point, the user can ask for a "nudge" or hint from an AI coach.
*   **AI-Generated Scorecard**: After the simulation, the user's entire conversation is analyzed. They receive a scorecard that rates their clarity, empathy, and assertiveness. It also provides a turn-by-turn breakdown of the conversation with specific feedback on what they did well and where they could improve.

### 4. Coaching & Development Hub

This feature is designed for a user's personal and professional growth, primarily for those in leadership roles.

*   **AI Recommendations**: The "Coaching" page collects all the AI-generated coaching recommendations from a user's 1-on-1 analyses. The user must either "Accept" a recommendation (which adds it to their development plan) or "Decline" it with a written justification.
*   **Decline Escalation**: If a recommendation is declined, it is escalated to the user's manager (e.g., an AM) for review, ensuring that valuable coaching advice isn't dismissed without oversight.
*   **Active Development Plan**: Accepted recommendations become active goals. Users can track their progress on these goals with a slider and add "check-in" notes to create a journal of their learning journey.
*   **AI Feedback Loop**: During subsequent 1-on-1s, the AI knows about these active goals and provides feedback on whether the user successfully applied their new skills or missed an opportunity to do so.

### 5. Manager's Lab: Specialized Training Programs

This is a dedicated area for managers to access and manage structured training programs for their team members.

*   **Interviewer Lab**: A program to train employees to become certified interviewers. Managers can nominate team members, who then go through a series of modules with lessons, quizzes, and practice simulations. The manager can track their nominee's progress from a pre-assessment to a final certification score.
*   **Leadership Development Program**: A program to groom high-potential employees for the next level of leadership (e.g., Employee to Team Lead). Managers can nominate their team members, who then receive access to a tailored curriculum of lessons and activities designed to build leadership skills like "Composure" and "Authenticity."

Each of these features is interconnected, creating a comprehensive system where performance is documented, analyzed for coaching opportunities, and then acted upon through structured learning and practice.
