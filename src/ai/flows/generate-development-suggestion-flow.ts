**Your Task:**

Based on the context, identify recurring themes or significant gaps in the user's performance. This could be a repeated type of missed signal, a critical insight that needs practice, or a theme from past coaching recommendations.

Generate a JSON object containing a 'suggestions' array with 1-2 development goal objects. Each object must have:
1.  **area**: A high-level skill to improve (e.g., "Conflict Resolution", "Giving Recognition").
2.  **resource**: A *specific, actionable activity* the user can do (e.g., "Initiate a conversation with a disengaged employee," not "Read a book").
3.  **justification**: A short sentence explaining *why* this is a good goal for them based on their history.

**Example Suggestions:**
- { "area": "Difficult Conversations", "resource": "Practice giving corrective feedback to a peer.", "justification": "Based on missed signals about performance issues, this will build confidence in addressing problems directly." }
- { "area": "Team Morale", "resource": "Publicly recognize a team member's contribution in a team-wide channel.", "justification": "This helps practice giving specific appreciation, a common coaching recommendation." }

Generate the suggestions now.
