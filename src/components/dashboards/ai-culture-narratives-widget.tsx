const narrative = "For Q2, the organization showed a 12% improvement in 'Accountability' and 'Clarity' scores, largely driven by the Engineering department's adoption of structured 1-on-1s. However, 'Empathy' scores saw a slight 3% decline in Sales, suggesting a potential area for targeted coaching intervention. Overall, a positive trend towards a more direct and responsible feedback culture is emerging.";
