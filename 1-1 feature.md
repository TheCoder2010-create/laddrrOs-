Feature: 1-on-1 Hub with Coaching & Nets (Detailed Version)
1. Background & Context
Organizations conduct regular 1-on-1 meetings, yet the intelligence from these conversations is rarely
retained or analyzed. Managers rely on memory and subjective judgment, causing repeated people issues,
inconsistent coaching quality, and delayed intervention.
2. Problem Statement
The absence of structured capture, analysis, and follow-through in 1-on-1s results in missed early-warning
signals, coaching recommendations that are not acted upon, and no safe environment to rehearse difficult
conversations.
3. Goals & Objectives
Convert leadership conversations into structured data, enforce accountability in coaching, and improve
managerial behavior through analysis and deliberate practice.
4. User Personas & RBAC
Supported personas include Employees, Team Leads, Managers/AMs, and HR Heads. Role-based access
control governs visibility, authority, and escalation paths.
5. Core Feature – 1-on-1 Hub
The 1-on-1 Hub is the primary system for scheduling meetings, capturing structured feedback, running AI
analysis, and triggering coaching and escalation workflows.
5.1 Pre-Meeting Briefing
AI-generated briefing packets summarize recent sessions, action items, open insights, and active coaching
goals to ensure continuity and preparedness.
5.2 Feedback Capture
Supervisors submit structured qualitative and quantitative feedback, including optional audio recordings or
transcripts, immediately after each meeting.
5.3 AI Analysis Output
AI produces supervisor and employee summaries, leadership and effectiveness scores, SWOT analysis,
coaching recommendations, action items, missed signals, and critical insights.
6. Sub-Feature – Coaching
Coaching recommendations generated from 1-on-1s must be accepted or declined. Accepted items become
tracked development goals; declined items trigger escalation.
6.1 Development Plan
Active coaching goals are tracked with progress indicators and reflective check-ins, creating a longitudinal
development record.
7. Sub-Feature – Nets (Scenario Practice Arena)
Nets allows users to practice difficult conversations in a safe AI-simulated environment directly linked to real
coaching gaps.
7.1 Simulation & Analysis
Users engage in roleplay scenarios and receive AI scorecards covering clarity, empathy, assertiveness, and
overall effectiveness, with annotated transcripts.
8. Critical Insight Escalation
High-risk insights trigger mandatory escalation workflows, ensuring issues are acknowledged and resolved
at the appropriate leadership or HR level.
9. Non-Functional Requirements
The system must ensure RBAC enforcement, explainable AI outputs, data integrity, and immediate feedback
across all workflows.
10. Success Metrics
Metrics include coaching adoption, Nets completion rates, reduction in repeated critical insights, and
improvement in leadership scores over time.
11. Product Definition
The 1-on-1 Hub transforms leadership conversations into structured intelligence, enforced coaching
accountability, and practiced behavioral improvement.
